/**
 * Resolve what happens after a sign-in request succeeds.
 *
 * Better Auth withholds the session when a second factor is required and
 * answers with `{ twoFactorRedirect: true, twoFactorMethods }` instead, so no
 * sign-in strategy may navigate to `redirectTo` unconditionally. This hook is
 * the single place that decision lives — every password-based form calls it
 * from `onSuccess`.
 *
 * The enabled methods are stashed in session storage (names only, never a
 * code or token) and `redirectTo` rides along in the query string so the
 * challenge view can finish the original navigation.
 *
 * The two-factor plugin is looked up by its stable id, so sign-in forms stay
 * installable without either the two-factor components or a matching release
 * of `@better-auth-ui/core`.
 *
 * @returns A callback taking the resolved data of a sign-in mutation.
